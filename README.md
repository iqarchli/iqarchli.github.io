# UX Design Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a selection of projects I’ve worked on as a UX Designer, focusing on concept development, prototyping, testing, and iteration.  
Each project reflects a different aspect of my design process — from improving 3D workflows to exploring new product opportunities through MVPs.

## About
I design user experiences that balance functionality and clarity, with a focus on how complex tools can feel intuitive and efficient.  
My background in computer science helps me collaborate closely with developers and product managers to bring ideas to life.

## Projects

### 1. **Cloud Collaboration App**
A platform enabling users to share and review visual work in real time.  
This project explored how designers and architects can exchange feedback more efficiently through a cloud-based environment.

### 2. **Highlight Key Materials in a 3D Context**
A feature concept that helps users focus on essential materials within complex 3D models.  
It simplifies material selection and improves clarity when navigating large scenes.

### 3. **VR Redesign**
A redesigned VR interface for architectural visualization, improving how users interact with 3D environments through controllers and on-world menus.  
The goal was to make immersive navigation feel more natural and less menu-driven.

### 4. **Football Scout App (MVP)**
A mobile MVP for football scouts to take quick notes and rate players during live matches.  
It helps scouts capture observations on the field and compare player performance later to support recruitment decisions.

### 5. **Style Transfer MVP**
An AI-assisted MVP that allows users to apply different visual styles to their 3D renderings.  
The goal was to explore how AI could enhance creative workflows by blending rendering outputs with artistic inspiration.


## Design Process
Each project follows a structured UX process:
1. **Research & Problem Framing** – Understanding user needs and pain points  
2. **Concept Exploration** – Ideating and sketching possible directions  
3. **Prototyping** – Building interactive mockups for early testing  
4. **User Testing & Feedback** – Validating assumptions and improving usability  
5. **Iteration & Delivery** – Refining the final experience for production or MVP handoff
